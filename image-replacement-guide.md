# Image Replacement Guide

## ✅ Task 2: Replace Images

To replace the old images (image1.jpeg, image2.jpeg, image3.jpeg) with your new ones:

### Steps:

1. **Prepare Your New Images:**
   - Ensure they are optimized for web (compressed, reasonable file size)
   - Recommended format: JPEG or PNG
   - Recommended dimensions: Similar to original images for consistency
   - File size: Under 200KB each for fast loading

2. **Replace the Files:**
   - Navigate to the `Images/` folder
   - Replace the following files with your new images:
     - `image1.jpeg` → Your new image 1
     - `image2.jpeg` → Your new image 2  
     - `image3.jpeg` → Your new image 3

3. **Keep the Same File Names:**
   - This ensures no HTML/CSS/JS changes are needed
   - The website will automatically use your new images

4. **Test the Website:**
   - Open `index.html` in a browser
   - Verify your new images appear correctly
   - Check that the website loads quickly

### Current Image Locations:
- `Images/image1.jpeg` - Currently 139KB
- `Images/image2.jpeg` - Currently 145KB  
- `Images/image3.jpeg` - Currently 146KB

### Tips for Image Optimization:
- Use tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim for compression
- Maintain aspect ratios similar to originals
- Test on different devices to ensure good display
- Consider creating multiple sizes for responsive design

### Note:
The website currently uses these images in the about section. If you want to use them elsewhere, you can update the HTML accordingly.
