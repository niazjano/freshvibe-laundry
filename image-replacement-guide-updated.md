## ✅ **Task 1: Replace Homepage Images**

### Current Images to Replace:
- `Images/image1.jpeg` (139KB)
- `Images/image2.jpeg` (145KB)  
- `Images/image3.jpeg` (146KB)

### New Images to Add:
1. `image1.jpg` – First banner/service highlight
2. `image2.jpg` – Second promotional/service image  
3. `image3.jpg` – Third featured service or brand trust image

### Steps to Replace:

1. **Prepare Your New Images:**
   - Ensure they are optimized for web (compressed, reasonable file size)
   - Recommended format: JPEG or PNG
   - Recommended dimensions: Similar to original images for consistency
   - File size: Under 200KB each for fast loading

2. **Replace the Files:**
   - Navigate to the `Images/` folder
   - Replace the following files with your new images:
     - `image1.jpeg` → Your new `image1.jpg`
     - `image2.jpeg` → Your new `image2.jpg`
     - `image3.jpeg` → Your new `image3.jpg`

3. **Keep the Same File Names:**
   - This ensures no HTML/CSS/JS changes are needed
   - The website will automatically use your new images

4. **Test the Website:**
   - Open `index.html` in a browser
   - Verify your new images appear correctly
   - Check that the website loads quickly

### Image Optimization Tips:
- Use tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim for compression
- Maintain aspect ratios similar to originals
- Test on different devices to ensure good display
- Consider creating multiple sizes for responsive design

### Current Image Usage:
- These images are used in the about section
- If you want to use them elsewhere, you can update the HTML accordingly
